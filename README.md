# streamlit_chp1
Streamlit checkpoint 1
What You're Aiming For
In this checkpoint, we are going to work on the 'Expresso churn' dataset that was provided as part of Expresso Churn Prediction Challenge hosted by Zindi platform.

Dataset description: Expresso is an African telecommunications services company that provides telecommunication services in two African markets: Mauritania and Senegal. The data describes 2.5 million Expresso clients with more than 15 behaviour variables in order to predict the clients' churn probability.

Instructions
Install the necessary packages
Import you data and perform basic data exploration phase
Display general information about the dataset
Create a pandas profiling reports to gain insights into the dataset
Handle Missing and corrupted values
Remove duplicates, if they exist
Handle outliers, if they exist
Encode categorical features
Based on the previous data exploration train and test a machine learning classifier
Create a streamlit application (locally)
Add input fields for your features and a validation button at the end of the form
Import your ML model into the streamlit application and start making predictions given the provided features values
Note: 

This checkpoint should be done locally, (Google colab notebooks won't work)
Make sure to run the app using the "streamlit run" command in your terminal.
